    Certitrack is a fairly simple, yet relationally complex Gift Certificate Management System (GCMS). Issue, track, edit, delete, and redeem certificates. Easily manage staff, clients and much more. Suitable for any organization or team.
</p>

Built with Microsoft's .NET Core stack, Certitrack leverages the power of a robust and secure relational SQL database.
  
This server-rendered app uses the Bootstrap-based AdminLTE frontend framework, along with AJAX requests where possible, yielding a fast and highly responsive user experience (UX). Certitrack is Dockerized and deployed with Azure Pipleines (CI/CD).

### Backstory

In the final few months of college, my class was beginning to explore advanced .NET Core development. Our instructor approached me (as her strongest student at the time), sharing that there was a request to build an application for the head of the Massage Therapy Department at the college.
  
He was in need of a robust web app that could help his department go paperless with their gift certificate issuing and tracking system. It was new, intimidating, and I had no idea how to make it happen. "Challenge Accepted" was what I replied with. Here we are today.
