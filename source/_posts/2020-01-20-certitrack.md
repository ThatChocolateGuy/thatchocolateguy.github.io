    Certitrack is a fairly simple, yet relationally complex Gift Certificate Management System (GCMS). Users can issue, track, delete, and redeem certificates - suitable for any organization or team.
</p>

Built with Microsoft's .NET Core stack, this project leverages the power of a robust and secure relational SQL database.
  
This server-rendered app uses the Bootstrap-based AdminLTE, along with AJAX requests where possible, resulting in a highly responsive and fast user experience (UX). Certitrack is currently being reworked into separate backend and frontend services to provide an even smoother UX.

### Backstory

During the final few months of my college program my class was starting to explore advanced .NET Core development. Our instructor approached me, sharing that there was a request for her to build an application for the head of the Massage Therapy Department at the college.
  
He was in need of a robust web app that could help his department go paperless with their gift certificate issuing and tracking system. It was new, intimidating, and I had no idea how to make it happen. "Challenge Accepted" was what I replied with. Here we are today.
